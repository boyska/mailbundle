Configuration
==============

Look at vars/examples/00-accounts.json ; now do a vars/10-accounts.json with your real
accounts configured
An example is in `example_variables.py`
The passwords should not stay there: you should put them in
	static/password/{{account.name}}
for example:
	echo -n 'myS3cr3Tp4ss!' > static/password/johndoe

Running
========

python3 + jinja2 is required. There are some ways to accomplish this.

Compatibility with python2 has been dropped.

System
-------

Just apt-get install python3-jinja2

But what if you move your mail bundle to a different computer, where you can't
install jinja2 systemwide?

Virtualenv
-----------

virtualenv3 --no-site-packages .ve
source .ve/bin/activate
pip install Jinja2
virtualenv3 --relocatable .ve

Virtualenv is pretty good at "relocation", because it completely runs in
userspace, without requiring root privileges.
However, the --relocatable option is less reliable than you could think. That
means, you could need to recreate the virtualenv on a different machine, which
is unpleasant.

Copy
-----

While this is "rough", it works pretty well.
Just copy the jinja2 directory that you created in your virtualenv using pip
into src/ and you're done.
That's the cool thing of having few dependencies!
